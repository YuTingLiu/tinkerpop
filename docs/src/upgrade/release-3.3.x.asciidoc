SparkGraphComputer GryoRegistrator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Historically, `SparkGraphComputer` has  used `GryoSerializer` to handle the serialization of objects in Spark. The reason
this exists is because TinkerPop uses a shaded version of Kryo and thus, couldn't use the standard `KryoSerializer`-model
provided by Spark. However, a "shim model" was created which allows for the shaded and unshaded versions of Kryo to
interact with one another. To this end, `KryoSerializer` can now be used with a `GryoRegistrator`. The properties file
for a `SparkGraphComputer` now looks as follows:

```
spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
spark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.spark.structure.io.gryo.GryoRegistrator
```

If the old `GryoSerializer` model is desired, then the properties file should simply look as before:

```
spark.serializer=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.spark.structure.io.gryo.GryoSerializer
```
